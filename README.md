In this code (fully functional, even kind slow when entering ACO routine) you can see that:  there are 2 scenarios:  FIRST) A WSN network WITHOUT ACO, consuming nodes energy because of routing protocol (shortestpath) using same route till nodes dieing.... SECOND) SAME WSN network of forst step WITH ACO, consuming nodes energy because of routing protocol (shortestpath) BUT changing routes because of ACO analisys of energy amount of the path in use.
